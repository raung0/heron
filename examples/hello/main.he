package main

// The use statment imports a module. The path determines the namespace access.
use core.io
// The way you access it can be also changed like so:
//   use core.io as io
//   io.println("...", ...)

// main is not a compile-time function, hence :=. If it were a compile-time
// function, it would be ::.
pub main := fn {
	core.io.println("Hello world!")
