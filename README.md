# Heron

Heron is a general-purpose systems programming language with a focus on
safety, and performance. It features a modern type system and compile-time code
execution.

## Quick Start

Use the following command to build from source:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will produce a `heron` binary, which is the main compiler, and a
`heron-format` binary which formats source files. Use `--help` to see how to
use them.
